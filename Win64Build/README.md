# Decentraland VR Explorer Proto

### Requirements

This build only runs in WINDOWS PCs and works with hopefully every VR device that's used running on a PC (it has been implemented using the SteamVR integration instead of brand-owned packages)

### Current state

This explorer is still in a super early stage, in slow development, not officially released by Decentraland, and based upon the "desktop explorer" branch started by Patricio Bosio at [Desktop Client](https://github.com/decentraland/explorer/tree/poc/desktop-client).

The current manual way of using this app is a bit clunky and annoying, and the world interactivity is limited as the UI usage hasn't been implemented yet.

### Usage instructions

1. Open the DecentralandUnityClient.exe and leave it running
2. ALT-TAB to your browser and open and authentiate into the following URL: https://play.decentraland.org/?position=0,0&ws=ws%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A5000%2Fdcl
3. In the browser you can see the world loading bar (if it's not working at once, try refreshing the URL), and after a while you should see a **green "Connected"** word, at this moment you can alt-tab into the running app again and put on your headset.
